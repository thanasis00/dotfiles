# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, in a current stable state (going to shrink down a bit soon).

## Generic dotfiles installation

Run `./setup.sh` to install generic dotfiles

## Vimrc and plugins installation

cd inside `vim` directory and run `rake`. This will copy files and  open vim to vundle install the plugins. Forget about the theme warning, it just shows up because the theme is not already downloaded (it will be once vundle install runs). Just press Enter and continue with installation.
